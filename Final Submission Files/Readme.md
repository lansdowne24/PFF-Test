Final submission files are in the "Final submission folder".  The rest of the items are working project files.

Please let me know if you need anything else!  (Also, my expertise is in Altium, and I have experience with Cadence Allegro from a previous place of emplyoment.  Would be happy to demonstrate this process in either if need be!)
